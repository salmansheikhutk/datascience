# Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive machine learning analysis on a breast cancer dataset to predict whether tumors are benign or malignant.

## Project Overview

**Dataset**: Breast Cancer Dataset (569 samples, 30 features)
- Features include measurements like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
- Target: Diagnosis (Benign vs Malignant)

## What We Accomplished

1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and explored the dataset structure
   - Converted diagnosis labels (M/B) to numerical values (1/0)
   - Removed unnecessary columns (id, unnamed columns)
   - Split data into features (X) and target (y)

2. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split data into 80% training (455 samples) and 20% testing (114 samples)
   - Maintained balanced class distribution

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained a Logistic Regression model on the training data
   - Used scikit-learn with random_state=42 for reproducibility

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Achieved **95.61% testing accuracy**
   - Created confusion matrix analysis
   - Calculated precision (97.50%), recall (90.70%), and F1-score (93.98%)
   - Visualized results with heatmap

## Key Results

- **Testing Accuracy**: 95.61%
- **Precision**: 97.50% (when predicting malignant, model is right 97.5% of the time)
- **Recall**: 90.70% (model catches 90.7% of all actual malignant cases)
- **False Negatives**: 4 cases (malignant tumors classified as benign)
- **False Positives**: 1 case (benign tumor classified as malignant)
